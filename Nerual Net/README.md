# Neural Network

This file is simply a scalable linear network, with an example case to work with shown [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

## Usage

There are two places in fc_net where the path needs to be changed. If you clone it simply open a terminal to the directory where trainval exists. Then type 

```bash
echo $PWD
```
From there copy the output and place it where your path exists. In the section of fc_net there is also a place towards the bottom where you insert the path. I use the pycharm IDE so this may not work for you as a driver for the network, but the lines below will run the code. 

```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    path = # Type your path here

```

## Contributing
This is simply a project, so Berkeley has given me most of the skeleton code. Use it as one wishes (not designed for threading, I would not recommend for use in anything other than learning).

## License
I dunno, use it if you want to?
